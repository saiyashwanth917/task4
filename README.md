# task4
This project performs binary classification using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The data is preprocessed, visualized, and split into training and test sets. Features are standardized, and a logistic regression model is trained using Scikit-learn. The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC curve. A sigmoid function plot and threshold tuning are included to demonstrate decision boundary effects. This project helps in understanding logistic regression and key classification metrics.
